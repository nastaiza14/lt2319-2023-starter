## !!UPDATE!!: Okay, now I see how the whole thing could have benefitted from using parallel states...
# Lab 3 Multimodality

Basic "choose the correct item" program.
Available in 3 languages.

## Improvements to be made:
- EVENTS on every click could have been more compact: instead of CLICK_DIV_1, CLICK_DIV_2, etc. there could have been 2 events: INCORRECT_CLICK and CORRECT_CLICK. 
- Position of items is not random, so its very easy to "guess" the word. I understand, however, that the goal of this lab was to train HTML and TypeScript.
